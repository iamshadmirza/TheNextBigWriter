## A bit about me , Who am I ?

Hey , my name is **Ameen**, I am 15 years old and currently in high school. I started learning to code when I was in second grade in school but never took it seriously until I was 11... That time I started learning **Unity** ( A Game Engine ) and **C#** but due to my PC's specs I couldn't continue on that path so instead of giving up  I started learning **Python**, learnt **PyGame** and a few more libs and built something basic with each of em .<br>
After losing interest in python, I started my hunt again .  I found Web Development after exploring. I soon started learning **web development** it just clicked with me . Didn't take me much time to master **HTML** but than school came in the way . 2 years later I again continued the **web dev path** with the ** #100DaysOfCode** challenge and am having fun ever since.<br>
I currently **work with** HTML,CSS,JavaScript and learning Svelte and built around 12-18 projects along side with it.That's enough about me let's get into the challenge.

## What is **#100DaysOfCode** ??

**#100DaysOfCode** is challenge where you have to code **1 hour** at minimum for **100** days straight.The only reason you can take a break is if you are sick, need to travel or just want to relax or take a break , just try not to take a break for more than 2 days at once .
That's pretty much it plan  to master something and code for 100 days straight and even tweet your progress on twitter :)

[Official Site](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) for the challenge.
The dev community on twitter is very supportive and welcoming .

## How I discovered the #100DaysOfCode Challenge?

I finally got some free time thanks to Summer Vacation. While wasting time and scrolling  through some blogs posts on FreeCodeCamp I found **#100DaysOfCode** . Since I had nothing to do ,I decided to take up the challenge . Being the guy I'm procrastinated for a week then finally started the challenge on 27 June . I missed a few days due to travelling and hit 50 days milestone on 18 of August .

## The Resources I used :

I have used **many resources**, I will be sharing the one's which had the **maximum impact** on me as well proved to be very useful ...


### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) 

Any praise won't be enough for the makers of **FreeCodeCamp** . If you want to learn **web-development** this should be your go-to site .It's amazing and has a great **supportive** community .When I wasn't learning I would be scrolling through their forums and answer/advice any question if I knew about that subject .. it definitely helped me to revise the concepts and stay on track. Their blog posts are amazing and really **informative** too .. So if you are a beginner and want to learn web development than this should be your go-to place.

### [One Month](https://onemonth.com/)

I got 1 month subscription for free thanks to **GitHub Student Pack** .. Their **JavaScript** course is amazing if you need to revise concepts and learn things by doing some cool projects .I went through their responsive design , **JavaScript** , product management , startup and growth hacker courses .If you can afford it I would highly suggest checking em out.

### [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)

If I am bored and want to play around with algorithms this is my goto place .. It's for all levels from beginner to expert and is just amazing and it's **FREE**

### [An amazing api list](https://any-api.com/)

I personally love APIs and this is the best resource so far ... search for an API .. go-to docs and rest will be history 

*Enough talk about resources will surely make another post on it and compile all of em into one*

## How has the challenge impacted me so far ?

I have learned to code HTML,CSS,JavaScript and currently learning svelte . I have built around 20 projects , met new people , learnt new things and made some really cool friends  on twitter and made it habit to code at least for an hour a day so hopefully heading in the right direction.

### What's my plan for remaining days ?

Just code and learn more , nothing decided as of now .. My main goal is to know a framework well and build some more projects with it .
