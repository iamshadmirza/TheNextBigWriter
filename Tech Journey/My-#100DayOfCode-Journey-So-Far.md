## A bit about me , Who am I ?
Hey , my name is Ameen , I am 15 years old and currently in high school. I started learning to code when I was in second grade in school but never took it seriously until I was 11... That time I started learning Unity ( A Game Engine ) and C# but due to my PC's specs I couldn't continue on that path so instead of giving up  I started learning Python , learnt pygame and a few more libs and built something basic with each of em .
But I didn't enjoy it as much and started to loose my interest in python. So the hunt to find something fun had began again . After exploring for a while ,I found "Web Development" , when I started learning web development it just clicked with me didn't take me much time to master html but than school came in the way . 2 years later I again continued the webdev path with the #100DaysOfCode challenge and am having fun ever since.
I currently know html , css , js and learning svelte and bult around 12 projects along side with it.That's enough about me let's get into the challenge.

## What is #100DaysOfCode ?

#100DaysOfCode is challenge where you have to code 1 hour at minimum for 100 days straight.The only reason you can take a break is if you are sick , need to travel or some extreme reason .
That's pretty much it plan something to master and code for 100 days straight and even tweet your progress on twitter :)

## The Resources I used :

I have used many resources , I will be sharing the one's which had the maximum impact on me as well proved to be very useful ...


### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) 

How much ever I praise the site .. it will be less . If you want to learn web-development this should be your goto site .It's amazing and has a great supportive community .When I wasn't learning I would be scrolling through their forums and answer/advice any question if I knew about that subject .. it definitely helped me to revise the concepts and stay on track. Their blog posts are amazing and really informative too .. So if you are a beginner and want to learn web development than this should be your goto place.

### [One Month](https://onemonth.com/)

I got 1 month subscription for free thanks to GitHub Student Pack .. Their javascript course is amazing if you need to revise concepts and learn things by doing some cool projects .I went through their responsive design , javascript , product management , startup and growth hacker courses .If you can afford it I would highly suggest checking em out.

### [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)

If I am bored and want to play around with algorithms this is my goto place .. It's for all levels from beginner to expert and is just amazing and it's FREE

### [An amazing api list](https://any-api.com/)

I personally love apis and this is the best resource so far ... search for an api .. goto docs and rest will be history 

Enought talk about resources will surely make another post on it and compile all of em into one

## How has the challenge impacted me so far ?

I learnt css , js and some what svelte so far ... I made some really cool twitter friends [ @prathamparsoon , @vasantdevelop , @jayanti_sharma , @codediv16 , @jatinrao ] and made it habit to code atleast for an hour a day so hopefully heading in the right direction

### What's my plan for remaining days ?

Just code more and learn more nothing decided but want to continue learning svelte along the way ...
