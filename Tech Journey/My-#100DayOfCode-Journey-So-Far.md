## A bit about me, Who am I?
Hey, my name is **Ameen**, I am 15 years old and currently in high school. I started learning to code when I was in second grade in school but never took it seriously until I was 11... That time I started learning **Unity** ( A Game Engine ) and **C#** but due to my PC's specs I couldn't continue on that path so instead of giving up  I started learning **Python**, learned **PyGame** and a few more libs and built something basic with each of em.
But I didn't enjoy it as much and started to lose my interest in python. So the hunt to find something fun had begun again. After exploring for a while, I found "**Web Development**", when I started learning web development it just clicked with me didn't take me much time to master HTML but then school came in the way . 2 years later I again continued the web dev path with the #100DaysOfCode challenge and am having fun ever since.
I currently know HTML, CSS, js, and learning svelte and built around 12-18 projects alongside with it. That's enough about me let's get into the challenge.

## What is **#100DaysOfCode** ??
**#100DaysOfCode** is a challenge where you have to code ** 1-hour** at minimum for **100** days straight. The only reason you can take a break is if you are sick, need to travel, or just want to relax or take a break, just try not to take a break for more than 2 days at once.
That's pretty much it plans to master something and code for 100 days straight and even tweet your progress on twitter :)

[Official Site](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) for the challenge.
The dev community on twitter is very supportive and welcoming.

## How I discovered the #100DaysOfCode Challenge?
My summer vacation had started, and I was going through some blog posts on FreeCodeCamp and read about the **#100DaysOfCode** and thought to myself what if I do the challenge ...  being the guy I'm procrastinated for a week and then finally started the challenge on 27 June missed a few days due to traveling and hit 50 days milestone on 18 of August.
 
##### My first day :

## The Resources I used :

I have used **many** resources, I will be sharing the one's which had the **maximum impact** on me as well proved to be very useful ...


### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) 

How much ever I praise the site .. it will be less . If you want to learn web-development this should be your goto site. It's amazing and has a great supportive community. When I wasn't learning I would be scrolling through their forums and answer/advice any question if I knew about that subject .. it helped me to revise the concepts and stay on track. Their blog posts are amazing and informative too... So if you are a beginner and want to learn web development than this should be your goto place.

### [One Month](https://onemonth.com/)

I got a One Month subscription for free thanks to **GitHub Student Pack**... Their javascript course is amazing if you need to revise concepts and learn things by doing some cool projects. I went through their responsive design, javascript, product management, startup, and growth hacker courses. If you can afford it I would highly suggest checking em out.

### [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)

If I am bored and want to play around with algorithms this is my goto place... It's for all levels from beginner to expert and is just amazing and it's **FREE**

### [An amazing api list](https://any-api.com/)

I personally love APIs and this is the best resource so far ... Search for an API .. goto docs and rest will be history 

*Enough talk about resources will surely make another post on it and compile all of em into one*

## How has the challenge impacted me so far?

I have learned to code HTML,CSS, and javascript, and currently learning svelte. I have built around 20 projects, met new people, learned new things, and made some cool friends on twitter and made it a habit to code at least for an hour a day so hopefully heading in the right direction.

### What's my plan for the remaining days?

Just code and learn more, nothing decided as of now .. My main goal is to know a framework well and build some more projects with it.
